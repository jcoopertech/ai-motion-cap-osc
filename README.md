# ai-motion-cap-osc
Using an AI motion capture solution to output OSC coordinates, to be used 


Heads up, those looking for this solution, this is a very dormant project.
If I ever find a reason to continue looking into this, I'll put the code here - but most likely not.

This link does what this project first set out to do, and I adapted part of AlwaysAI with a python OSC library to send positional data into TouchDesigner.
It worked for the most part, but was only a few minutes of coding - so not really worth sharing here - and would likely breach AlwaysAI's licence.
